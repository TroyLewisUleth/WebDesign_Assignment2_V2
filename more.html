            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>GMOs were a topic of discussion in Biology 2500. I found it quite interesting because of how GMOs are perceived by the public, how it has a negative connotation attached to it and how people may use it as a marketing ploy to promote other products or to drive people away from GMOs. On the other hand, what I found fascinating is that almost every fruit we eat, common ones like watermelons or bananas are considered GMOs too, they have been domesticated over decades in the past, before we even knew how we were doing so or the science behind it. Just by replanting the seeds of the best plants or produce we have been creating GMOs over thousands of years.</p>
