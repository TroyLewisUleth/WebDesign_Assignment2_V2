                <h3>What Are They?</h3>
                <p>Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs): GMO plants are plants that have had their DNA altered through genetic engineering to introduce new traits, such as resistance to pests, tolerance to herbicides, or improved nutritional content.</p>

                <h3>Enhanced Crop Performance</h3>
                <p>GMO plants are often designed to withstand environmental stresses, like drought or extreme temperatures, and can produce higher yields, making them a popular choice for agriculture in challenging climates.</p>

                <h3>Extensive Safety Testing and Regulation</h3>
                <p>GMO plants undergo rigorous testing and are regulated by organizations like the FDA, WHO, and EFSA to ensure they are safe for consumption and the environment.</p>

                <h3>Do GMO Plants Cause Cancer?</h3>
                <p>Current scientific studies show no evidence that GMO plants cause cancer. Extensive research and regulatory assessments by organizations such as the FDA, WHO, and the National Academy of Sciences have found that GMOs on the market are as safe to consume as non-GMO foods. However, ongoing research continues to monitor potential health impacts.</p>
